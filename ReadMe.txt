		level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity

         Each person also has information about their personality. 
		Personality measurements (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, 
		agreeableness, and conscientiousness), impulsivity, and sensation seeking

	We also have information that tells us which drug a person has used in the past and when. 
		Going from never to in the last day.
